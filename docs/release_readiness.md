# Release Readiness

PocketMind now has the core storage, trust-boundary, and build gates needed for
internal testing. Broad external distribution still needs the remaining release
items below.

## Completed

- MIT license added in `LICENSE`.
- Recommended model manifest pins upstream revision, byte size, and SHA-256.
- Recommended downloads are registered only after SHA-256 verification.
- Legacy recommended files are registered as `LegacyUnverified` and verified
  asynchronously before they can become active.
- Custom URL/imported models remain `UnverifiedCustom`, even when their file
  name matches a recommended model.
- Chat sessions, messages, model registry, and download records use Room.
- Non-sensitive settings use DataStore; remote API keys use encrypted storage.
- Remote model transport requires HTTPS, except local HTTP debug hosts.
- Remote streaming uses OkHttp and cancels the underlying call when stopped.
- PR verification is local-only by default; model URL provenance is manual or
  scheduled with `VERIFY_MODEL_URLS=1`.
- Memory is documented as a lightweight local index. Action planning is
  documented as experimental model planning with rule fallback.

## Remaining

- Add a privacy notice covering local chat storage, remote context transfer,
  encrypted API key storage, model downloads, and Android intents.
- Document upstream model licenses in addition to provenance hashes.
- Configure release signing outside source control.
- Run `connectedDebugAndroidTest` on a physical device or a prepared emulator
  before publishing a release candidate.
- Add a manual release checklist for store metadata, screenshots, and rollback.
